# the egos of TrumpWorld

This is a Shiny app for exploring the ego networks of persons and organizations included in BuzzFeed's TrumpWorld dataset. The app should be live [here](https://corybrunson.shinyapps.io/trumpworld/), and the README for the original BuzzFeed repo is copied below.

# TrumpWorld Data

This repository contains the data behind TrumpWorld, as described in [this BuzzFeed News article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/johntemplon/help-us-map-trumpworld). In addition to the tabular files already represented in the TrumpWorld spreadsheet, this repository also includes a [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) file of the data, for ease of importing into network analysis and visualization software.

If you have suggestions for expanding or improving the dataset, please email __trump@buzzfeed.com__. If you’d like to send your tip securely and anonymously, [see these instructions](https://tips.buzzfeed.com/). (Please do not submit GitHub pull requests.)

__Update, April 24, 2017:__ We’ve simplified TrumpWorld’s tabular data. Previously, the TrumpWorld data was distributed across three CSV files: person-person-connections.csv, person-org-connections.csv, and org-org-connections.csv. Now all of that data has been consolidated into a single CSV: [trumpworld.csv](data/trumpworld.csv). No information has been removed from TrumpWorld; it has just been streamlined. In addition, the GraphML representation of TrumpWorld now include each node’s type (i.e., “person” / “organization”).
