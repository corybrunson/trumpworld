# TrumpWorld Data

This repository contains the data behind TrumpWorld, as described in [this BuzzFeed News article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/johntemplon/help-us-map-trumpworld). In addition to the tabular files already represented in the TrumpWorld spreadsheet, this repository also includes a [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) file of the data, for ease of importing into network analysis and visualization software.

If you have suggestions for expanding or improving the dataset, please email __trump@buzzfeed.com__. If youâ€™d like to send your tip securely and anonymously, [see these instructions](https://tips.buzzfeed.com/). (Please do not submit GitHub pull requests.)
