<p>The ascendant president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, is at the center of a global network of business and financial relationships, which has introduced unprecedented conflicts of interest for the president and his associates. In another development without recent precedent, Trump has refused to release his tax returns, shielding his ongoing business relationships from public scrutiny. To help better understand Trump's web of dependencies, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/johntemplon/help-us-map-trumpworld">BuzzFeed is compiling</a> a <a href="https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/trumpworld">dataset</a> of persons and organizations with close ties to Donald Trump and his administration.</p>

<p>A natural way to represent this data is as a mathematical graph, consisting of person and organization nodes linked according to the relationships listed in the dataset. This representation is called an <b>affiliation network</b>, and a sizable chunk of the social network analysis literature is devoted to the study of such networks. (See <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/43068408/CarrollSapinski_2011_CorporateElitesAndIntercorporateNetworks_PreProof.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1486393221&Signature=M72XGqOZVSHO6f4QwERSZRNOBes%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCorporate_Elites_and_Intercorporate_Netw.pdf">here (PDF)</a> for a thorough review.)</p>

<p>This simple app allows the user to pick a person or organization from BuzzFeed's data and view their immediate neighborhood in the web. Such a neighborhood is called an <b>ego network</b>, hence the title. Use the inputs in the sidebar to customize the dataset (the Data tab) and graph (the Plot tab), and click or drag to identify nodes in the plot. I apologize for the roughness of the interface; this is new territory for me. Suggestions (or wholesale replacements) are welcome.</p>
